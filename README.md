Project ShieldPro
Overview
Project ShieldPro is a machine learning project aimed at classifying fake profiles on Instagram. It utilizes Random Forest Classifier and LightGBM algorithms to effectively identify fake profiles based on various features.

Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure that you have collected a dataset containing features of Instagram profiles, including but not limited to follower count, post count, engagement rate, etc. Make sure to have labels indicating whether each profile is fake or genuine.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Future Extensions
NLP Integration: Incorporate natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis on the profile descriptions. This can provide additional insights into the authenticity of profiles.

Enhanced Feature Engineering: Explore additional features from Instagram profiles or external sources to improve the model's performance further.
